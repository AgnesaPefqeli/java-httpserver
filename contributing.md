# Contributing

All are welcome, and should, contribute if they feel like it. We have only a few
requirements (and, for the most part, we'd probably be willing to forgive you if
you didn't follow them, especially on the coding standards part).

## Coding Standards

We don't have a specific coding style guide, but do try to make any new code
look like existing code. This may be difficult because there are some
conflicting styles in older and newer code, but just try. We'll note anything
that seems amiss.

## Making a code contribution

It's probably best if you make a fork, develop on your fork, and submit a pull
request to us. We'll look at it, probably try it out, and either make
suggestions or pull it in.

## Other kinds of contributions

External documentation is something we really need. Also, if you run into
anything that even seems mildly bug-like to you, please submit a new issue to
our issue tracker. We want to know about these things.
