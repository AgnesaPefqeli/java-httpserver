# Java HTTP Server
An HTTP Server, written in Java!

This is the basis of the HTTP server written for 
[Storyteller](http://storytellersoftware.com). The main reason this is being
released is that there really isn't a good HTTP server available for Java, and
we wrote one that we consider acceptable, and think other people might want to
use.

All of the code in this repository is licensed under the MIT License (see
license.md for details).

This stuff is currently being worked on because we don't want to leave
references to other Storyteller code in this code, and there are some changes
and optimizations that are being made. Everything is being rewritten just to 
make sure we don't leave references to the rest of Storyteller, and so that it's
looked at in its entirety, again.
